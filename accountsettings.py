'''Implement a program that allows users to manage their account settings. Provide options to update their personal
information (e.g., name, email address, password) and communication preferences (e.g., subscription to newsletters,
promotional emails).

Note: Assume the account information are name, email address and password. The program saved the customer details in
three list. A list comprises the names, another the email addresses and the third has the passwords. If a user has
his name at position x in the first list, his email address will be found at the same position in the second lit and
his password will be also saved in the same position in the third list. Write a program that takes as input the userâ€™
email address and password to validate and then enable the user to update personal information (email address must be
unique) and communication preferences.
